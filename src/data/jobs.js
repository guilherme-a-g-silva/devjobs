      We are seeking an experienced and visionary Enterprise Hyper-Senior Frontend Integration Engineer to lead and architect the development of complex, scalable, and secure frontend ecosystems across multiple business units and product lines. This role requires deep technical expertise, strong leadership capabilities, and a strategic mindset to align frontend architecture with enterprise goals.

      As a key member of our global engineering team, you will be responsible for designing and implementing high-performance UI frameworks that support millions of users across multiple platforms. You will collaborate closely with backend architects, product owners, DevOps, QA, and other stakeholders to ensure technical feasibility, code consistency, and long-term scalability.

      Responsibilities:
      - Define and drive the enterprise-wide frontend architecture strategy across micro-frontend platforms and component libraries.
      - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to translate complex business requirements into elegant, maintainable, and testable user interfaces.
      - Standardize code quality, accessibility (WCAG 2.1), and performance metrics across frontend teams.
      - Design integration strategies for legacy and modern systems using technologies such as Web Components, Module Federation, GraphQL, and REST.
      - Evaluate and implement tooling for automated testing, static analysis, CI/CD pipelines, and real-time telemetry collection.
      - Lead technical deep dives, code reviews, and architectural design sessions with senior engineers.
      - Act as a mentor and technical coach for junior and mid-level developers across distributed teams.
      - Stay ahead of frontend trends and guide adoption of best practices around WebAssembly, server-side rendering (Next.js), progressive enhancement, and offline-first strategies.

      Required Qualifications:
      - 10+ years of professional frontend development experience, with at least 3 years in a leadership or staff-level role.
      - Expert proficiency in JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, and modern SPA frameworks (React preferred).
      - Deep understanding of browser rendering behavior, performance optimization, and security (XSS, CSP, etc.).
      - Proven track record of designing frontend architectures in enterprise environments with large-scale user bases.
      - Experience working with component libraries, design systems, and accessibility standards.
      - Strong communication and collaboration skills in complex, multi-team environments.

      Preferred Qualifications:
      - Experience with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, CircleCI), containerized environments (Docker), and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
      - Familiarity with monorepo architectures (Nx, Turborepo) and package management (npm, Yarn, pnpm).
      - Contributions to open-source projects or active involvement in the frontend community.
      - Previous experience in highly regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government) is a plus.

      We Offer:
      - Competitive salary and performance-based bonuses
      - Flexible remote-first work environment with international team collaboration
      - Dedicated learning budget for conferences, certifications, and training
      - Access to cutting-edge tools and infrastructure
      - A clear career path into Staff Engineer and Principal Architect roles

      If you're looking for a role that challenges you technically, encourages architectural ownership, and places you at the center of a modern enterprise transformation, we would love to hear from you.
